# Role Requirements 

- 

- The minimum hour requirement to stay as a trail-mod is 9 hours per week, failure to reach this requirement will result in a conversation with upper staff and if the issue persists, you may be demoted/removed from the staff team. In addition to this, in order to be **considered** for a promotion, you must reach at least 16 hours per week.

**Please remember that staff members are always expected to fulfill the requirements of all of the positions before them to some degree, keeping that in mind, the main focuses of your roles will be outlined here.**
