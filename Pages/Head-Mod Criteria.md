# Role Performance

Head-Mod is arguably the most unique position on the entire staff team, the main purpose of the role is to act as the link between upper and lower staff. As head-mod, the tasks of a mod will not completely disappear, although you will gain a few important responsibilities that may take up some of your time. You will work closely with admins learning how to host/config admin events and assist in reviewing individuals job preformance to determine the next generation of upper staff.

The last task being introduced to you will be training, you will join staff admin+ in training staff, prepping them for their staffing career. As someone with the most knowledge on moderation, you may be asked to train new moderators frequently, be sure to introduce yourself and make a connection, you may be their mentor one day!

# Role Requirements 

- The head-mod position is suited towards an extremely capable staff member who might not be able to put in the time requirements of an upper staff member or who may just may be content in a moderation position. 

- It's extremely important that the head-mod is an active participant in the community, members both staff and players may come to you often as their point of contact with upper staff, if it's an issue that must be dealt with by someone admin+, simply pass on the message and reasure the player that the issue will be resolved soon. 

- It's likely that head-mod will recieve the 3 next potential moderators we are considering for upper staff as mentees, it's your job to access their job preformance and provide detailed mentee reports so we can make an informed final decision.   

- The minimum hour requirement to stay as head-mod is 10 hours per week, failure to reach this requirement will result in a conversation with upper staff and if the issue persists, you may be demoted/removed from the staff team. In this position, typically individuals aren't looking for a promotion, so any hours more then reqiured are not nessessary but greatly appreciated. 

**Please remember that staff members are always expected to fulfill the requirements of all of the positions before them to some degree, keeping that in mind, the main focuses of your roles will be outlined here.**
