If promoted to trail-mod, it means the staff community has recognized your work and commitment to the server up until this point. Now although it may be early, the jump from helper to trail-mod is a big one. The role is meant to hone your skills on server moderation allowing you to have a wider range of permissions such as social spy, teleport, temp-ban privileges, and more.

If you are confused on how you should act on a situation contact your mentor. They will work through the issue with you.
