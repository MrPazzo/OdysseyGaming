# Staff Expectations


It should come as no suprise to you that as a member of the staff team it is expected of you to act with a sense of maturity and respect while interacting with others within the community. As well, following and enforcing all server rules should go without saying... this section will inform you on you should act as a staff member, reminding you of staff rules, server rules, and overall just making sure everyone's got some common sense.
