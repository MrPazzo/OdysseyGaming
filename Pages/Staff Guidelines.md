# Staff Expectations


It should come as no suprise to you that as a member of the staff team it is expected of you to act with a sense of maturity and respect while interacting with others within the community. As well, following and enforcing all server rules should go without saying... 

Each of you have been selected to represent the community as a leader, meaning you are now considered a role model in the community. This section will inform you on how you should act as a staff member, reminding you of staff rules, server rules, and overall just making sure everyone's got some common sense.

### Staff Rules & Regulations 

1. Be patient and kind with ALL players and staff, if a member is being disrespectful towards you, contact your mentor or an upper staff member to handle the situation.
2. If you come to learn about a future update that has not been officially released yet, do **NOT** leak any contents of the update, leaking anything will result in a full demotion and possibly a ban.
3. While your time on the staff team we ask that you do not block any staff or players.
4. If the Network has multiple servers online, and you see that a server is unstaffed, you are required to join that server **even** if it is not your main server.
5. In order to recieve a staff promotion, reaching the required number of hours for that promotion is certainly important, but not only what we base them off of.
6. Under no circumstance should a staff member use profanity towards another player.
7. If you're leaving for a while and need to go on Staff Time Away, send a message to your mentor with the reason and however long you expect to be away.
