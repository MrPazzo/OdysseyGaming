# Role Performance

The moderator role adds three very important jobs to your roster; event hosting, responding to tickets, and becoming a mentor. In order to be able to complete these tasks you will gain access to the permissions /vanish and /fly. As a moderator, /vanish may only ever be used while hosting an event. You may use /fly as you please.

Please remember that it's crucial to always keep a calm head when dealing with tickets. Often players will come to you frustrated because something has gone wrong, let them know the issue will be resolved fairly and if you need assistance feel free to contact anyone mod+. We would also like to point out that becoming a mentor is a big responsiblity. Mentors who develop genuine relationships with their mentees and stand out in leadership roles are characteristics that we look for most prominently in upper staff. Be sure to check out your [Mentor Responsibilities](https://github.com/MrPazzo/OdysseyGaming/blob/main/Pages/Mentor%20Responsibilities.md) to know how to be a great mentor!

# Role Requirements 

- Visit #mod-chat in the staff discord and look at pinned messages to view what commands to run step by step for each event. Some events may require you to manually distribute rewards. The commands to access the event kits will also be found in mod chat.

- If for any reason you want to request a mentee transfer, dm somebody admin+ and they will retrieve the google doc link for you. Fill it out and submite and you will be updated shortly.

- As a mentor, you are the first person of contact for your mentees in almost any situation, try your best to respond to them quickly if asked for help. If one of your mentees happens to go off rails you may be held accountable depending on the situation. 

- The minimum hour requirement to stay as a mod is 10 hours per week. Failure to reach this requirement will result in a conversation with upper staff and if the issue persists, you may be demoted/removed from the staff team. In addition to this, in order to be **considered** for a promotion, you must reach at least 18 hours per week.

**Please remember that staff members are always expected to fulfill the requirements of all of the positions before them to some degree. Keeping that in mind, the main focuses of your roles will be outlined here.**
