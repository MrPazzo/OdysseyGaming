# Role Performance

The moderator role adds three very important jobs to you're roster; event hosting, responding to tickets, and becoming a mentor. In order to be able to complete these tasks you will gain access to the permissions /vanish and /fly. As a moderator, /vanish may only ever be used while hosting an event, you may use /fly as you please.

Please remember that it's crucial to always keep a calm head when dealing with tickets, often players will come to you frustrated because something has gone wrong, let them know the issue will be resolved fairly and if you need assistance feel free to contact anyone mod+. I would also like to point out that becoming a mentor is a big responsiblity, Mentor's who develop genuine relationships with their mentee's and stand out in leadership roles are characteristics that we look for most prominently in upper staff. Be sure to check out your [Mentor Responsibilities](https://github.com/MrPazzo/OdysseyGaming/blob/main/Pages/Mentor%20Responsibilities.md) to know how to be a great mentor!
